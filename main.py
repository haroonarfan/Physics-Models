# Kinematics
# 1. What do I know?
# 	 WEP, ConEn, Equations of motions, Tensions, Newtonâ€™s 1st 2nd and 3rd law,
# 	 acceleration graphs, friction, Experimental Law
# 2. What is feasible or something that I should make in python?
# 	    i. Graphs of displacement against velocity for acceleration in directions,
# 	    ii. Make graphs for the trajectory of projectiles in wind
# 	    iii. Make collision simulations - if possible.
# 	    iv. Make velocity/acceleration/displacement/distance/time etc predictions.
# 	    v. Friction modelled
# 	    vi. If possible allow GUI models.
